1. Define Project Objectives and Requirements:

    Clearly outline the objectives and goals of my project, including what you aim to achieve and the specific requirements you need to fulfill.
    Identify the key features and functionalities of my application, such as data ingestion, processing, analysis, visualization, and user interaction.

2. Conduct Initial Research:

    Research existing solutions, technologies, and best practices relevant to my project, including data engineering frameworks, web development tools, and cloud services.
    Explore available APIs and data sources from platforms like Steam, GOG.com, and Itch.io to understand their data formats, access methods, and usage limitations.

3. Choose Technologies and Architectural Components:

    Select the technologies and architectural components that best suit my project requirements and objectives.
    Choose programming languages, frameworks, and libraries based on my familiarity, project complexity, and scalability needs (e.g., Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy).
    Decide on cloud services and infrastructure options (e.g., AWS) for hosting my application, managing databases, and processing data.

4. Set Up Development Environment:

    Set up my development environment with the necessary tools and dependencies for coding, testing, and debugging.
    Install Python and required packages using package managers like pip or conda.
    Configure version control with Git and set up a repository to track changes to my project codebase.

5. Implement Data Ingestion:

    Start by implementing data ingestion functionality to fetch game metadata from APIs of platforms like Steam, GOG.com, and Itch.io.
    Write code to make HTTP requests to API endpoints, retrieve data, and store it locally or in a database for further processing.

6. Develop Data Processing Logic:

    Develop data processing logic to transform and clean the ingested data, ensuring consistency and quality.
    Use Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, transformation, and validation as part of my ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

7. Design Database Schema:

    Design a database schema to store game metadata and related information, considering factors such as data structure, relationships, and indexing for efficient querying.
    Implement database models using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework like SQLAlchemy to interact with the database programmatically.

8. Build Web Application Components:

    Develop web application components, including user interfaces, API endpoints, and backend services, using frameworks like Flask for Python-based web development.
    Design interactive visualizations and user interfaces to enable users to query and explore game data effectively.

9. Test and Debug:

    Write unit tests and integration tests to validate the functionality of my application components and ensure they meet the specified requirements.
    Perform thorough testing and debugging to identify and fix any issues or bugs in my codebase.

10. Deploy and Iterate:

    Deploy my application to a staging environment or cloud platform (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk) for testing and validation.
    Gather feedback from stakeholders and users, and iterate on my application based on their input and observations.
    Continuously monitor and optimize my application for performance, scalability, and user experience.

11. Document and Maintain:

    Document my project architecture, design decisions, and implementation details to facilitate future maintenance and collaboration.
    Maintain regular backups of my codebase and documentation, and establish procedures for version control and release management.
