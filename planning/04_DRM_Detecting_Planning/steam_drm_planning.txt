I need to determine which DRM are being used for which games.

I'll need a list of games from steam as a first step, then I'll need to find a way to detect which DRM are associated with each game. 
Accuracy and relevence of each game is important here, as out-of-date data will send the wrong message.

Example: if a game had Denuvo at one point, and no longer does today: then it should be flagged as not having Denuvo (maybe could have a "did have it before" flag?)
    - can use the Steam listing page?


    Use Sonic Frontiers as an example, as that has Denuvo listed on the Steam page.
