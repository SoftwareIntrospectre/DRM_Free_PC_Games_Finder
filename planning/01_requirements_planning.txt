6. Data Visualization:

    Priority: Medium
    Description: Develop data visualization components for displaying game data.
    Tasks:
        Choose appropriate visualization libraries (e.g., Plotly, D3.js).
        Implement visualizations for displaying game metadata and search results.

7. Integration and Testing:

    Priority: Medium
    Description: Integrate backend, frontend, and testing components.
    Tasks:
        Connect Flask routes to data model and database.
        Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipeline.
        Test integration between Flask application, data pipeline, and visualization components.

8. Implement Search Functionality:

    Priority: Medium
    Description: Develop search functionality for querying game data.
    Tasks:
        Implement logic to process user search queries (e.g., by title, genre, DRM status).
        Integrate search functionality with database queries.

9. CI/CD Setup:

    Priority: Medium
    Description: Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
    Tasks:
        Choose and set up CI/CD tool (e.g., GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions).
        Define CI pipeline stages for building, testing, and code quality checks.
        Configure CD pipeline stages for deployment to staging and production environments.

10. Deployment:

    Priority: Low
    Description: Deploy the application to a production environment.
    Tasks:
        Configure deployment environment (e.g., cloud platform, server).

        Provide setup instructions for development environment and deployment.
        Create user guide for navigating and using the application.

12. Continuous Improvement and Feedback:

    Priority: Low
    Description: Incorporate feedback, iterate on the application, and continuously improve.
    Tasks:
        Gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
        Iterate on the application based on feedback and performance metrics.
        Regularly review and update documentation, tests, and codebase.
