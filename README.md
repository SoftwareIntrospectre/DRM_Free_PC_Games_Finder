This is a project to more easily pc games without Digital Rights Management (DRM). This came about because so much of modern games are about
"purchasing a license" to use. I've seen many cases of games being delisted, removed from accounts, locking people out of their purchases, etc.
and I'm sick of it.

This is meant to be a tool to make it more convenient for myself and others to support the creators they like
while also protecting their rights as customers. If there is a game that has DRM on one platform but not another,
I want to create a simple and easy way to inform the user on how to find it.

This will also be used to show how many options are actually available for DRM-free options. An informed
customer can help promote better practices in the market, and hopefully in time this can lead to publishers
adopting more consumer-friendly practices.

If you get value out of this, please let me know and star this repo. Thanks!
