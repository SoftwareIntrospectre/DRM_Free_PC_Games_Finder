Pull in data from multiple sources to determine which games are DRM-free and which ones are not

- have an application that people can use to search metadata about a game to see if it's possible to get it on a DRM-free format or not.


DRM definition:
    - requires any kind of 3rd party launcher to run
    - on Steam: requires Steam's launcher to run
    - online: cannot be played offline (including check-ins)

DRM free:
    - game can be purchased one time, backed up,
    and used on multiple computers


Why: I reject the idea that "buying" a game means "purchasing a license",
which in essence means my purchase can be revoked at any time by the company I bought it from.
I don't like this idea, and I want to educate myself and others on games that do not
promote this policy, and show people where to get them.

I also want to find the statistics of which games are truly DRM-free, and which ones are not.

This will be for PC digital games, as there is not really an option for digital-games without DRM on consoles. 
The best option there is to buy a physical copy.

I want to do this to help myself and my friends with this.


Explain why this matters:
    - If Steam went out of business for any reason, all of the games that you purchased would be lost if you needed to re-download them.


- write automated tests
- write good logging/error messages

        - query should be LIKE, not necessarily exact

            - Timesplitters
                - only mention official store fronts


Itch.io: no DRM
    - check the download link just in case this changes
    - offer as an alternative if the game is available there

GOG.com: no DRM
    - check the download link just in case this changes
    - offer as an alternative if the game is available there

Will help: Check to see if game exists on Steam without DRM
    - inform people that this game is not owned by you. You're free to pay for it, but it can be removed by the company per the license agreement
        - show the license agreement
